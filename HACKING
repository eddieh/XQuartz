Build requirements

* GNU Make 4.3
* Autotools
* Meson (for Mesa)
  - if using Homebrew simply installing meson might not give you a
    working build system:

        Attempting to run meson may produce an error

          meson.build:901:2: ERROR: Problem encountered: Python (3.x)
          mako module >= 0.8.0 required to build mesa.

        In which case some manual introvention may be required.

        $ pip3 list
